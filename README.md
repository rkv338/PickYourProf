# PickYourProf

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
There was no easy way to get personalized professor choices. Looking for a professor requires hours of looking through numerous review sites, university catalogs, etc. We've simplified that for you.

<h3>What it does</h3>
Rate My Prof analayzes the UT directory of professors and gives your recommendations for professors based on Rate My Professor ratings and university reviews.

<h3>How we built it</h3>
Our app has a light front-end with HTML and CSS. We have a powerful node web app powered by an Express.js server. The Node.js file is responsible for scraping data from websites and a large JSON formatted file that lists every UT professor and course.

<h3>Challenges we ran into</h3>
It was difficult getting and posting data from the front end to the NODE server. Every browser has different dependencies we had to meet.

<h3>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h3>
We were able to fetch every single UT Austin course and Professor.

<h3>What we learned</h3>
We learned a lot of full stack development.

<h3>What's next for Pick Your Prof</h3>
We plan on expanding to more universities in Texas and even add analytics.
