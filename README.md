# PickYourProf

Inspiration
There was no easy way to get personalized professor choices. Looking for a professor requires hours of looking through numerous review sites, university catalogs, etc. We've simplified that for you.

What it does
Rate My Prof analayzes the UT directory of professors and gives your recommendations for professors based on Rate My Professor ratings and university reviews.

How we built it
Our app has a light front-end with HTML and CSS. We have a powerful node web app powered by an Express.js server. The Node.js file is responsible for scraping data from websites and a large JSON formatted file that lists every UT professor and course.

Challenges we ran into
It was difficult getting and posting data from the front end to the NODE server. Every browser has different dependencies we had to meet.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to fetch every single UT Austin course and Professor.

What we learned
We learned a lot of full stack development.

What's next for Pick Your Prof
We plan on expanding to more universities in Texas and even add analytics.
